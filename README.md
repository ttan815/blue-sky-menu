<H1>Blue Sky Restaurant Website</H1>
<h4>This is a project I built in the summer of 2023, where I wanted to refine my abilities in Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Django so I put all those skills together to create this website for my parent's restaurant website. Right now, it's just a prototype and I want to refine it to be industry-quality in the future.
Right now, it has the basic search functionality down so that you can search for items on the menu.</h4>
